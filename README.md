# Collide2D for Processing.py
A very basic version of [Ben Moren's Collide2D](https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D) for Processing.Py created for [CS4All NYC's](https://sites.google.com/schools.nyc.gov/cs4allnyc/home) [ICM version 2.0 in Python](https://bit.ly/cs4allicm2py).

Creation would not have been possible without [Jeffrey Thompson's Collision Detection site](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/table_of_contents.php) which is truly an amazing and valuable resource.
